the DET

The DET

his DET

started VERB

but CONJ
the DET

would VERB

called VERB
out PRT

him PRON
a DET

His DET

something NOUN
anybody NOUN

on ADP

As ADP

he PRON
wouldn't VERB

Actually ADV
, .
he PRON
regretted VERB

opened VERB

mouth NOUN
when ADV
the DET
truck NOUN
came VERB
to ADP
a DET
stop NOUN
and CONJ
the DET
angry ADJ
driver NOUN
jumped VERB
down PRT

walked VERB

By ADP
then ADV

the DET
stranger NOUN
was VERB
thanking VERB

had VERB
one NUM
arm NOUN
around ADP

So ADP
the DET

started VERB

curse VERB

if ADP
they PRON
had VERB

Then ADV

saved VERB
turned VERB

looked VERB
squarely ADV
into ADP

truck NOUN
driver's NOUN
face NOUN

without ADP

Very ADV
suddenly ADV

the DET
driver NOUN
stopped VERB

turned VERB

heel NOUN
and CONJ
went VERB

Haney NOUN

Now ADV
he PRON
recalled VERB
it PRON
very ADV

wondered VERB
what DET
the DET
truck NOUN
driver NOUN
had VERB
seen VERB
in ADP
those DET
eyes NOUN
to PRT

him PRON
back VERB
off PRT

It PRON
must VERB

been VERB
the DET

look NOUN
that PRON

without ADP
saying VERB

When ADV

they PRON
went VERB
on PRT

And CONJ
when ADV
the DET

found VERB
out PRT
that ADP
Phil NOUN

one NUM

he PRON
insisted VERB

Phil NOUN
usually ADV

sitting VERB

passing VERB

even ADV

money NOUN

Phil NOUN

Now ADV
he PRON

having VERB

He PRON
really ADV

When ADV

finally ADV

he PRON

Haney NOUN

Phil NOUN

Maybe ADV

Once ADV

he PRON

After ADP

why ADV

The DET

the DET

correlating VERB

The DET

the DET

therefore ADV

It PRON

Another DET

was VERB
the DET
grammatical ADJ
construction NOUN

Consider VERB

Instead ADV

Siddo NOUN

Thus ADV
, .
the DET
masculine ADJ
animate ADJ
infinitive NOUN
dabhumaksanigalu'ahai X

meaning VERB

the DET
future NOUN

The DET

Plus ADP
the DET
fact NOUN
that ADP

three NUM

The DET

And CONJ
that DET

the DET

I PRON
first ADV

her PRON
when ADV
my DET

brought VERB
her PRON
into ADP
his DET
antique NOUN

That ADP
she PRON
impressed VERB
me PRON

I PRON

that ADP
when ADV
our DET

we PRON
both DET

them PRON

I PRON
thought VERB
I PRON
saw VERB
a DET
faint ADJ
surge NOUN

rise VERB

her DET
neck NOUN
and CONJ
quickly ADV

her DET

True ADV

she PRON

my DET
Aunt NOUN

married VERB

an DET
Uncle NOUN
related VERB

me PRON
only ADV
by ADP

but CONJ
why ADV
she PRON

married VERB
a DET

twice ADV
her DET

and CONJ
more ADJ
, .
perhaps ADV
, .
I PRON
did VERB

She PRON
was VERB
standing VERB
with ADP
her DET
back NOUN

the DET

Her DET

was VERB
silhouetted VERB

with ADP
the DET
strong ADJ

I PRON
could VERB
see VERB
the DET

a DET
body NOUN
that ADP
an DET

anyone NOUN

As ADP
it PRON
is VERB
in ADP
so ADV
many ADJ

the DET

, .
a DET

and CONJ
a DET

something NOUN

Something NOUN
clicked VERB
in ADP
this DET

but CONJ
I PRON
treated VERB
her PRON
circumspectly ADV

I PRON
felt VERB
that ADP

for ADP
we PRON
both DET

our DET

When ADV
she PRON
appeared VERB
at ADP
the DET

out PRT

a DET

even VERB
my DET
looking NOUN

her PRON
was VERB
surreptitious ADJ
lest ADP

And CONJ
then ADV
I PRON
became VERB
aware ADJ
that ADP
she PRON
, .
too ADV

glanced VERB
at ADP
me PRON
surreptitiously ADV

I PRON
felt VERB
that ADP
her DET
eyes NOUN
were VERB
undressing VERB
me PRON
as ADP
if ADP
she PRON
were VERB
a DET
painter NOUN
and CONJ
I PRON
a DET

I PRON
dismissed VERB
these DET
feelings NOUN
as ADP
wishful ADJ

but CONJ
I PRON
could VERB
not ADV
get VERB
it PRON
out ADP
of ADP
my DET
head NOUN
that ADP
we PRON
had VERB
a DET
strong ADJ
physical ADJ
attraction NOUN
for ADP
one DET
another DET
and CONJ
we PRON
both DET
feared VERB
to PRT

on ADP
it PRON
because ADP
of ADP
our DET

When ADV
our DET
eyes NOUN
met VERB
the DET
air NOUN
was VERB
filled VERB
with ADP
an DET
unuttered ADJ
message NOUN
of ADP
`` .
Me PRON

You PRON
have VERB
probably ADV
experienced VERB
this DET

It PRON
is VERB
nothing NOUN

put VERB
your DET
fingers NOUN
on PRT
but CONJ
the DET
air NOUN
suddenly ADV
fills VERB
with ADP
a DET
high ADJ
charge NOUN
of ADP
electricity NOUN

Why ADV
she PRON
married VERB
him PRON
I PRON
do VERB
not ADV

I PRON
myself PRON
was VERB
fond ADJ
of ADP
him PRON
but CONJ
what DET
a DET
young ADJ

half PRT
his DET

saw VERB

him PRON
was VERB
a DET
mystery NOUN
to ADP

He PRON
already ADV

that PRON

she PRON
herself PRON

all PRT

Perhaps ADV

with ADP
my DET

she PRON
found VERB
a DET

that PRON

she PRON

her DET

some DET

For ADP
several ADJ

we PRON

then ADV
one NUM

Uncle NOUN

his DET

I PRON

Even ADV

she PRON

it PRON
I PRON
became VERB

of ADP
a DET
give-away ADJ

that PRON
suffused VERB
her DET

moved VERB
upwards ADV

subconsciously ADV
I PRON
realized VERB
that ADP
when ADV
she PRON
entered VERB
the DET

she PRON
did VERB
not ADV
switch VERB

the DET

The DET
cavernous ADJ

I PRON

the DET

There PRT

I PRON

I PRON

suddenly ADV
she PRON

her DET

Her DET

I PRON

`` .

It PRON

When ADV

Even ADV

It PRON
was VERB
an DET
awkward ADJ
hour NOUN
, .
but CONJ
I PRON
didn't VERB
have VERB
to PRT
punch VERB
any DET
time NOUN
clock NOUN
, .
and CONJ
it PRON
only ADV
meant VERB
that ADP
sometimes ADV
I PRON
had VERB

stay VERB
a DET
couple NOUN
of ADP
hours NOUN
later ADV
at ADP
the DET
drawing VERB
board NOUN
to PRT

up PRT
a DET

. .

After ADP
a DET
short ADJ
time NOUN
, .
both DET
George NOUN
and CONJ
Donald NOUN
joined VERB
the DET
class NOUN
with ADP
me PRON
so ADP
they PRON
wouldn't VERB
feel VERB
lonely ADJ
, .
and CONJ
we PRON
used VERB
to PRT
hang VERB
a DET
sign NOUN
on ADP
the DET
door NOUN
of ADP
the DET
Brush-off NOUN
reading VERB
out PRT
to PRT
work VERB
. .

It PRON
was VERB
mostly ADV
for ADP
the DET
benefit NOUN
of ADP
the DET
mailman NOUN
, .
because ADP
hardly ADV
anybody NOUN
else ADV
ever ADV
visited VERB
us PRON
. .

In ADP
a DET
way NOUN
, .
Askington NOUN
was VERB
right ADJ
. .

`` .
Stimulating ADJ
'' .
was VERB
the DET
word NOUN
for ADP
it PRON
. .

I PRON
don't VERB
know VERB
that ADP
it PRON
was VERB
always ADV
as ADV
rewarding ADJ
as ADP
I PRON
had VERB
expected VERB
it PRON
to PRT
be VERB
. .

Partly ADV
, .
it PRON
was VERB
because ADP
Pendleton NOUN
himself PRON
wasn't VERB
what DET
I PRON
anticipated VERB
. .

I PRON
had VERB
come VERB
prepared VERB
to PRT
worship VERB
at ADP
the DET
feet NOUN
of ADP
this DET

, .
and CONJ
he PRON
turned VERB
out PRT
to PRT

a DET
rather ADV
bitter ADJ
old ADJ
man NOUN
who PRON
smelled VERB
of ADP
dead ADJ
cigars NOUN
. .

No ADV
, .
that DET
isn't VERB
quite ADV
fair ADJ
. .

Actually ADV
, .
there PRT
was VERB
a DET
lot NOUN
of ADP
force NOUN
in ADP
him PRON
, .
which DET
is VERB
why ADV
I PRON
kept VERB
on PRT
in ADP
that DET
class NOUN
instead ADV
of ADP
quitting VERB
after ADP
a DET

. .

Such PRT
a DET
little ADJ

-- .
the DET

`` .

She PRON
asked VERB

`` .
I PRON

find VERB
it PRON

the DET

'' .
. .

`` .
Via NOUN

, .
I PRON
answered VERB
readily ADV
enough ADV
, .
recalling VERB
her DET
last ADJ

`` .
Via NOUN
'' .
, .
she PRON
was VERB
frowning VERB
. .

`` .
Why ADV
should VERB
Via NOUN
have VERB
it PRON
'' .
? .
? .

Had VERB
she PRON
forgotten VERB
she PRON
had VERB
signed VERB
the DET
car NOUN
away ADV
, .
that ADP
whatever DET
they PRON
mutually ADV
owned VERB
had VERB
been VERB
divided VERB
among ADP
the DET
children NOUN
? .
? .

I PRON
was VERB
silent ADJ
. .

I PRON
didn't VERB
want VERB
to PRT
stir VERB
things NOUN
up PRT
. .

`` .
I PRON
drive VERB
my DET
own ADJ
car NOUN
by ADP
courtesy NOUN
of ADP
Via NOUN
'' .
? .
? .

`` .
I'm PRT
sure ADJ
she'd PRT

it PRON
over ADP
to PRT
you PRON
, .
if ADP
you'd PRT
rather ADV

You PRON
know VERB
that DET
'' .
. .

She PRON
looked VERB
as ADP
if ADP
she PRON
were VERB
accusing VERB
me PRON
of ADP
some DET
fraud NOUN
. .

`` .
She PRON
must VERB
have VERB
taken VERB
the DET

when ADV
she PRON
went VERB
to ADP
Walter's NOUN

I'll PRT

. .

`` .
No ADV
, .
thank VERB
you PRON

I PRON
want VERB
nothing NOUN
of ADP
Via's NOUN
'' .
. .

Why ADV
should VERB
this DET
suddenly ADV
assail VERB
her PRON
? .
? .

Walter NOUN
was VERB
giving VERB
me PRON
checks NOUN
for ADP
my DET
pay NOUN
, .
the DET
household NOUN
bills NOUN
. .

Had VERB
she PRON
been VERB
in ADP
such PRT
a DET
turmoil NOUN
that ADP
this DET
had VERB
slipped VERB
her DET
mind NOUN
? .
? .

`` .
What DET
a DET
fool NOUN
I've PRT
been VERB
'' .
, .
she PRON
said VERB
quietly ADV
. .

`` .
I PRON
knew VERB
all PRT
this DET

but CONJ
I PRON
paid VERB
no DET
attention NOUN
. .

I PRON
don't VERB
even VERB
own VERB
the DET
house NOUN
I'm PRT
standing VERB
in PRT

I PRON
was VERB
so ADV
sure ADJ
it PRON
was VERB
all PRT
temporary ADJ
that ADP
we PRON
would VERB
all PRT
embrace VERB
, .
and CONJ
then ADV
the DET
lawyer NOUN
would VERB
tear VERB
up PRT
all PRT
those DET
things NOUN

`` .
It PRON
narrows VERB
down PRT
down PRT
down PRT
and CONJ
finally ADV
there PRT
is VERB
no DET

If ADP
I PRON
am VERB
not ADV

Mrs. NOUN
Salter NOUN
I PRON

. .

I PRON
suppose VERB
I PRON
should VERB
have VERB
paid VERB
attention NOUN
to ADP
that ADV
half-murmured ADJ
remark NOUN
, .
but CONJ
it PRON
seemed VERB
one NOUN
of ADP
those DET
extreme ADJ
statements NOUN
women NOUN
under ADP
stress NOUN
indulge VERB
in PRT
. .

I PRON
love VERB
you PRON
, .
I PRON
hate VERB
you PRON
, .
I PRON
feel VERB
like ADP

you PRON
and CONJ
myself PRON

and CONJ
in ADP
the DET

sequence NOUN
I PRON
love VERB
you PRON
I PRON
think VERB
you're PRT
the DET
most ADV
wonderful ADJ
the DET
most ADV
noble ADJ
and CONJ
so ADV
on PRT
and CONJ
on PRT
, .
meanwhile ADV
eating VERB
a DET
good ADJ
breakfast NOUN
and CONJ
dinner NOUN
and CONJ
enjoying VERB
living VERB

So ADP
I PRON
went VERB
about ADP
my DET

I PRON
made VERB
a DET
lemon NOUN
sponge NOUN
, .
a DET
light ADJ
dessert NOUN
, .
roasted VERB
a DET
chicken NOUN

parboiled VERB
some DET

so ADP
there PRT
would VERB

something NOUN
nice ADJ
in ADP

icebox NOUN
for ADP
the DET
weekend NOUN

`` .
Don't VERB

she PRON

Sunday NOUN
with ADP
Dolly NOUN

'' .
. .

At ADP
last ADJ
, .
I PRON
thought VERB

she's PRT
recovering VERB
her DET
spirits NOUN

With ADP
this DET
movie-to-be NOUN
in ADP
London NOUN

and CONJ
new ADJ

there ADV
, .
she PRON
would VERB
soon ADV
be VERB
a DET
more ADV
tranquil ADJ
, .
a DET
wiser ADJ
person NOUN
, .
all PRT
the DET
better ADJ
for ADP
her DET
stay NOUN
out PRT
here ADV
. .

I PRON
felt VERB
more ADV
cheerful ADJ
, .
as ADP
if ADP
I PRON
had VERB
had VERB
a DET
part NOUN
in ADP
bringing VERB
her PRON
through ADP
to ADP
a DET
greater ADJ
tolerance NOUN
of ADP
herself PRON
. .

And CONJ
I PRON
went VERB
back ADV
to ADP
my DET
own ADJ
cottage NOUN
to PRT
live VERB
my DET
own ADJ
little ADJ
patch NOUN
of ADP
life NOUN
. .

It PRON
was VERB
foggy ADJ
that DET
evening NOUN
, .
but CONJ
the DET
path NOUN
to ADP
my DET
house NOUN
was VERB
so ADV
well ADV
grooved VERB
that ADP
I PRON
could VERB
feel VERB
my DET
way NOUN
, .
accustomed VERB

I PRON
was VERB
to ADP
the DET
dense ADJ

that PRON
rise VERB
from ADP
the DET
sun-warmed ADJ
palisades NOUN
of ADP
the DET
river NOUN
and CONJ
sometimes ADV
last VERB
for ADP
days NOUN

In ADP
the DET
morning NOUN
the DET
fog NOUN
was VERB
still ADV
thick ADJ
so ADP
that ADP
to PRT
go VERB
to ADP
the DET
village NOUN
I PRON
crept VERB
along ADV
with ADP
my DET
headlights NOUN
full ADV
on PRT

I PRON
did VERB
notice VERB
a DET
twinkle NOUN
of ADP
light NOUN
from ADP
the DET
big ADJ
house NOUN
through ADP
the DET
woods NOUN
but CONJ
as ADP
I PRON
had VERB
left VERB
a DET
light NOUN
on PRT
in ADP
my DET
own ADJ
house NOUN
because ADP
of ADP
the DET
fog NOUN
I PRON
assumed VERB
Mrs. NOUN
Salter NOUN
had VERB
done VERB
the DET
same ADJ
before ADP
she PRON
left VERB
for ADP
town NOUN

I PRON
did VERB
my DET
shopping NOUN
, .
had VERB
my DET

and CONJ
from ADP
there ADV
I PRON
went VERB
to ADP
the DET
women's NOUN
lunch NOUN
at ADP
our DET
parish NOUN
church NOUN
where ADV
we PRON
discussed VERB
plans NOUN
for ADP
the DET
annual ADJ
Christmas NOUN
bazaar NOUN

so ADP
that DET
dusk NOUN
was VERB
beginning VERB

gather VERB
when ADV
I PRON
drove VERB
home NOUN
in ADP
the DET
late ADJ
afternoon NOUN
. .

But CONJ
the DET
next ADJ
day NOUN
-- .
Sunday NOUN
. .

Why ADV
, .
when ADV
I PRON
drove VERB
down PRT
to ADP
church NOUN
, .
didn't VERB
it PRON
speak VERB
to ADP
me PRON
, .
seeing VERB
the DET

still ADV
on PRT
and CONJ
the DET
day NOUN
crisp NOUN

? .
? .

Prisoners NOUN
brought VERB

they PRON

you PRON

When ADV
I PRON
came VERB
back ADV
from ADP
church NOUN
at ADP
noon NOUN
Mrs. NOUN
Thaxter NOUN
was VERB
turning VERB
into ADP
the DET
Salter NOUN

Even ADV
at ADP
a DET

length NOUN
I PRON
could VERB
sense VERB
that ADP
something NOUN
was VERB
wrong ADJ
, .
and CONJ
so ADP
I PRON
followed VERB
her PRON
up ADP
to ADP
the DET
turnaround NOUN
in ADP
front NOUN
of ADP
the DET

. .

Dolly NOUN
Engisch NOUN
was VERB

`` .

She PRON

both DET

ran VERB
up ADP

and CONJ
I PRON
followed VERB

The DET

down PRT

Everything NOUN

it PRON
the DET

before ADP

her DET

only ADV
her DET

And CONJ
she PRON

Then ADV
the DET

I PRON
, .
who PRON
until ADP
that DET
day NOUN
before ADV

been VERB
Mrs. NOUN
Salter's NOUN

It PRON
was VERB
Dolly NOUN

Mrs. NOUN
Thaxter NOUN
who PRON
were VERB

everybody NOUN

And CONJ
when ADV
they PRON

they PRON
spoke VERB

not ADV

And CONJ
after ADP
I PRON
brought VERB

sandwiches NOUN

coffee NOUN
I PRON
had VERB

go VERB
back ADV
to ADP
my DET

in ADP
the DET

and CONJ
wait VERB
. .

Sitting VERB
in ADP
the DET

I PRON
recalled VERB
every DET

Mrs. NOUN
Salter NOUN
said VERB
that DET

have VERB
been VERB

`` .
If ADP
I PRON

Why ADV

me PRON
then ADV
? .
? .

And CONJ
when ADV
she PRON
returned VERB
from ADP
taking VERB
her DET

back VERB

New ADJ

she PRON

And CONJ
then ADV
I PRON

a DET

before ADV
after ADP
their DET

from ADP
a DET

Rome NOUN
I PRON

`` .
On ADP

I PRON

just ADV

The DET
last ADJ

but CONJ
the DET

was VERB
always ADV
busy ADJ

it PRON
reassured VERB
me PRON

I PRON
assumed VERB
it PRON

Dolly NOUN

she PRON

But CONJ
it PRON
seemed VERB

Then ADV

it PRON
a DET
final ADJ

Hanging VERB

She PRON

I PRON
tried VERB

Sometimes ADV

It's PRT

With ADP
all PRT

it PRON

She PRON

Suddenly ADV

`` .

I PRON

`` .

I PRON

I PRON

Anyway ADV

She PRON

I PRON

Somehow ADV

Not ADV

now ADV
he PRON

I PRON

It PRON

his DET

Johnnie NOUN

innocent ADJ

that DET

At ADP

Johnnie NOUN

But CONJ
what DET

I PRON

I PRON
later ADV

I PRON
felt VERB
no DET

I PRON

many ADJ

I PRON

my DET

Johnnie NOUN
who PRON
, .
being VERB
thirty NUM

brought VERB

I PRON

a DET

how ADV
God NOUN

look VERB
on ADP
true ADJ

and CONJ
so ADV
in ADP
a DET

I PRON

my DET

God NOUN

my DET

pure ADJ
until ADP

I PRON

There PRT

Of ADP
this DET

I PRON

no DET

Of ADP
course NOUN
he PRON

He'd PRT
not ADV
only ADV

me PRON
so ADP

he'd PRT

it PRON

It PRON
wasn't VERB
Johnnie's NOUN
fault NOUN
that ADP
he PRON

hopelessly ADV

that DET
frightful ADJ
woman NOUN
who PRON
did VERB
her DET
best ADJ

his DET

Just ADV
because ADP
he PRON
was VERB
honorable ADJ
enough ADV

continue VERB
supporting VERB
his DET
two NUM

as ADP
any DET

that DET

no DET
reason NOUN
he PRON

his DET

And CONJ
if ADP
I PRON

that DET

I'd PRT
do VERB
it PRON

The DET
cost NOUN

No DET

And CONJ
I PRON
had VERB
no DET

I'd PRT

not ADV

I PRON
all PRT

him PRON

He PRON

plenty ADV
attentive ADJ

all ADV

but CONJ
he PRON
behaved VERB

and CONJ
I PRON
figured VERB
that ADP
, .
emotionally ADV

I PRON
was VERB
closer ADV

his DET
age NOUN
than ADP
to ADP
my DET

eighteen NUM

a DET
half PRT

What DET
could VERB
a DET

matter VERB
? .
? .

It PRON
wasn't VERB

I PRON
was VERB
sure ADJ
, .
a DET

in ADP
age NOUN
that PRON

a DET

him PRON

She'd PRT

her PRON

After ADP
all PRT

Lucille NOUN
Warren NOUN

a DET

But CONJ
I'd PRT

now ADV
God NOUN

It PRON

A DET

I'd PRT

but CONJ
I PRON
still ADV

him PRON

five NUM

But CONJ
I PRON
had VERB
looked VERB

so ADV
much ADV
to ADP

this DET

I PRON
hadn't VERB
been VERB
doing VERB

much ADJ

as ADP
I PRON
used VERB

Westfield NOUN
and CONJ
I PRON
felt VERB
funny ADJ
about ADP

wanted VERB

work VERB
harder ADV

I PRON
wanted VERB
to PRT
just ADV
throw VERB
myself PRON
into ADP
the DET
good ADJ

of ADP
this DET
fine ADJ

So ADP
I PRON
went VERB

Boston NOUN

The DET
first ADJ

held VERB
in ADP
Faneuil NOUN
Hall NOUN

a DET

where ADV
we PRON

My DET
cousin NOUN
Alma NOUN

at ADP

I PRON
was VERB
staying VERB
during ADP
the DET
convention NOUN

introduced VERB
me PRON

Rhode NOUN

One NUM

them PRON

a DET

about ADP
my DET

slick ADJ

blond ADJ

blue ADJ

He PRON

different ADJ

Johnnie NOUN

in ADP

, .
he PRON
looked VERB
sort NOUN
of ADP

I PRON
thought VERB

he PRON

it PRON

Alma NOUN

too ADV

After ADP
the DET
meeting NOUN
, .
there PRT

going VERB

a DET

at ADP
someone's NOUN
house NOUN

I PRON
assumed VERB
Alma NOUN

get VERB
me PRON

, .
but CONJ
in ADP
the DET
confusion NOUN
of ADP
the DET

breaking VERB
up PRT

we PRON

Outside ADP
the DET

I PRON
anxiously ADV

then ADV
all PRT
at ADP
once ADV
there PRT

`` .

Ronald NOUN

I PRON
couldn't VERB

`` .
Well PRT

I PRON

I PRON

`` .
Alma NOUN

I PRON
went VERB

By ADP
the DET

we PRON

the DET

already ADV

strong ADJ

A DET

I PRON
realized VERB

were VERB
drinking VERB

My DET
folks NOUN
wouldn't VERB
dream VERB
of ADP
having VERB
alcohol NOUN
in ADP
the DET

so ADP
my DET
first ADJ

with ADP
Johnnie NOUN

I PRON
hadn't VERB

it PRON

it PRON

But CONJ
when ADV
Johnnie NOUN
disguised VERB
the DET

, .
I PRON

it PRON
. .

Of ADP
course NOUN
I PRON
enjoyed VERB
'most ADV
anything NOUN

it PRON

Johnnie NOUN

Johnnie NOUN
I PRON
suddenly ADV

all PRT
evening NOUN

But CONJ
that DET

I PRON

surely ADV
he PRON

`` .
I PRON

I PRON

`` .
Okay PRT

But CONJ
at ADP

The DET

Strange ADJ

most ADJ

I PRON
wasn't VERB
even ADV

all PRT

Under ADP

Today NOUN
